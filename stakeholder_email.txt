Hello Daniel,

My name is Vishal and I'm an Analytics Engineer working here. Pleasure to e-meet you!

I was recently tasked with exploring, modeling and unveiling a key insight using the assessment data. I discovered a
couple of issues with the data using Python, and I was wondering if you could provide more insight into them:

1. In the "users.json" file, there seem to be a considerable number of duplicates as well as entries created by
Fetch staff. I've taken care of the issue for now, but I'm wondering if there is a specific reason for this, and
whether we can handle this issue at the source?

2. There is a similar issue in "brands.json" where there exist a few "test" barcode entries created by Fetch staff.
It isn't a huge problem for now, but it could mess with any potential insights once the volume of data increases.

In addition to these, it would be helpful to have a description for each field in the "items" table in the ERD
(This table is derived from the "receipts.json" file).

Having this information would go a long way towards better optimization of these data assets.

I also noticed that some of the questions being asked of the data are quite similar to each other. While writing
SQL queries for each bullet point is doable, it might benefit future performance to make use of materialized views,
which is more efficient than querying the database from scratch.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Looking forward to your response!

Best,
Vishal
